## Hi I'm Micha!

I am a front-end developer who enjoys designing, creating, and programming things for the web. Focused on finding simple and easy solutions to problems, and writing performant, high-quality, and functional code.  

I love learning new things, reading, drawing, and spending lots of time with the love ones.
